Diary Log
[03/28/17] - I got simple circuit microphone component from RadioShack and I was trying to record something with Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately, many suggestions online said that it is not capable of doing that. So, I am thinking about what I learned from EE233 Circuit Theory class about recording change in voltage over time. Hence the first thing that I will do is the learn how to record change in voltage with the Pi. To do that, I used this website as a guidance.
